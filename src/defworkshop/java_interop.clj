;; # Generating Java Classes
;;
;; ## Simple Java Class generation
;;
;; You can also generate Java classes from Clojure code. For thay you can use `gen-class`
;;
;; Implement a simple Java class, Java version of which would look like that:
;;
;;        package workshop_tasks_implemented.java_interop;
;;
;;        public class Shout {
;;
;;          public String state;
;;
;;          public Shout(String str) {
;;            this.state = str.toUpperCase();
;;          }
;;
;;          public String toString() {
;;            return this.state;
;;          }
;;        }
;;
;; `gen-class` receives attributes, such as:
;;
;;   * `:constructors` maps the arguments of the class' constructor to the arguments of the super
;;      class' constructor. This is used to determine which constructor is supposed to be called.
;;   * `:state` deﬁnes a method which will return the object's state.
;;   * `:init` deﬁnes the name of the initialiser. This is a function which has to return a vector.
;;      The first element is again a vector of arguments to the super class constructor. In our case
;;      this is just the empty vector. The second element is the object's state.
;;   * `:name` fully qualified name of the class (together with package).
;;
